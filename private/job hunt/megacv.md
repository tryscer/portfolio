> My superpowers: research and high-signal user interviews, plus an unusual mix—history & philosophy, hands-on coding, long-form writing, and hardware tinkering. That mix helps me find non-obvious solutions and ship them.

# Jonathan Silver: Senior PM

## About Me

I love my users.

I'm a senior product manager living at the crossroads of **AI** and **UX**. Deep curiosity into people and innovation led me to be a journalist. It still keeps me running as I help create that innovation.

My superpowers are **research** and **high‑signal user interviews**. I bring creative problem solving from an unusual background: a degree in history & philosophy, hands‑on coding, a writing career, and hardware tinkering. That mix helps me see non‑obvious solutions and ship them.

## How I Work

### People First
Teams that feel safe, respected, and included do their best work. I use a **"Three Amigos"** approach (PM × Design × Engineering) so solutions live at the intersection of vision (UX), reality (R&D), and focus (PM).

### User‑Centric
I don't build products; I build **user enablers**. Deep understanding drives outcomes; delight is designed, not accidental.

### Follow the Bat‑Signal
Product development is noisy. I set clear goals, keep motivation aligned, and keep the ship on course.

### There's No Such Thing as Too Much Research
I've never regretted one more interview, one more Hotjar session, or one more market scan. The more I know, the better the ideas.

### Proactive Transparency
Products die in darkness. I keep every corner of the product cycle visible and accessible.

### Name Bad Ideas Fast
There is such a thing as a stupid idea. I call it quickly—respectfully—and move on.
