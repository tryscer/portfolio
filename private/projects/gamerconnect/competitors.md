- LFG-specific apps win via UX focus and UA, but face retention pressure vs. Discord/server gravity.
- Tournaments and UGC hubs create sticky communities that can be integrated rather than fully replaced.
- Regional incumbents (WhatsApp/Telegram/VK/WeChat) are essential surfaces for acquisition and community mirroring.

Notes
- Figures compiled from public company disclosures, store listings, and widely cited industry summaries as of 2023–2025. Many services do not report MAU/DAU; where unavailable, values are marked “Not disclosed.”
