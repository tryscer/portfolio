## Document Metadata
Describe owner, contributors, versioning strategy, and change log location. Include links to the decision log and related repositories/prototypes.

## Program Overview
Summarize the multi‑epic initiative: what it is, who it serves, and the business outcomes expected. Keep to 4–6 sentences and link to any one‑pager or positioning docs.

## Vision and Strategy Alignment
Explain how this initiative supports the product/company strategy. Note any north‑star metrics, investment themes, and strategic bets.

## Problem Statement
Define the user and business problems at program scope. Quantify current pain (e.g., conversion, retention, costs) and outline root causes.

## Success Criteria and OKRs
List program‑level Objectives and Key Results (3–5). Include an OMTM for the initiative and guardrails (e.g., error rates, opt‑outs). Put target values and time horizons.

## Stakeholders and RACI
Identify key stakeholders (product, design, engineering, marketing, legal, ops). Provide a lightweight RACI (even if you’re a solo operator, state how reviews and decisions happen and when you’ll seek external input).

## Target Users and Personas
Define primary and secondary personas. Include motivations, constraints, and context of use. Note any segments by geography, device, or experience level.

## Market and Competitive Landscape
Summarize direct/indirect competitors and alternatives. Identify table‑stakes vs differentiators and any switching costs. Link to deeper research.

## Scope and Boundaries
Describe what the overall program will and will not address. Include a boundary diagram in prose (inputs, system, outputs) and note any phased ambitions.

## Assumptions and Constraints
List assumptions you are making across technology, operations, budget, and legal/regulatory. Document hard constraints (e.g., SLAs, platform limits, timelines).

## Non‑Goals / Out of Scope
Call out work explicitly not planned in this initiative to avoid scope creep. Explain rationale where helpful.

## High‑Level Architecture
Provide an end‑to‑end conceptual view: key components, data flows, and third‑party systems. Include security boundaries and where state is stored. Link to diagrams if available.

## Epics Summary
Provide a one‑table summary of epics with goals, owners, and status. Example columns: Epic, Outcome, Priority (P0/P1/P2), Start, ETA, Risks, Dependencies.

## Release Plan and Milestones
Lay out phases (e.g., MVP → P1 → P2), key milestones, and exit criteria for each. Include a high‑level timeline and any launch gates (beta cohorts, GA criteria).

## Risks and RAID Log
Maintain a RAID (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies) log at the program level. For each item, track owner, impact, likelihood, mitigation, and status.

## Communications Plan
Describe cadences for status updates, stakeholder reviews, and decision making. Include channels (docs, Slack, standups) and artifacts (demo videos, metrics dashboards).

## Security, Privacy, and Compliance (Program)
Outline the overarching posture: data classification, encryption, access control model, auditability, and applicable regulations (GDPR/CCPA/PCI/HIPAA). Note program‑wide privacy UX (consents, notices) and DPIA needs.

## Operational Readiness (Program)
Define SLOs, error budgets, on‑call/incident response approach, logging/monitoring standards, and rollback policies that epics must conform to.

## Go‑To‑Market (Program)
Summarize positioning, audience, channels, pricing/packaging hypotheses, and the learning plan across launches. Link to campaign briefs.

## Dependencies (Program)
List cross‑team/external dependencies with owners and dates. Note critical path items and fallback options.

## Open Questions (Program)
Track unresolved questions that affect multiple epics. Assign owners and due dates to drive closure.

## Epic Template (Repeat per Epic)
Use the following sub‑sections for each epic. Duplicate this section once per epic and fill accordingly.

### Epic Title and ID
Provide a short, action‑oriented title and a unique identifier. Include a one‑sentence outcome statement.

### Epic Overview
Explain the purpose and value of this epic. How it contributes to program OKRs. Keep to 3–5 sentences.

### Objectives and Success Metrics
List epic‑level objectives and 2–4 measurable KPIs (with targets). Define guardrails relevant to this epic.

### In‑Scope / Out‑of‑Scope (Epic)
List capabilities included in this epic and what is explicitly excluded or deferred.

### User Stories (Titles Only)
Provide a numbered list of user stories in title form. Use INVEST criteria to keep them crisp.

### Detailed Requirements
- Functional Requirements (FR‑#): Numbered, testable requirements with Must/Should/Could priority.
- Non‑Functional Requirements (NFR‑#): Performance, reliability, security, a11y, localization, scalability.

### UX and Content Requirements
Describe key flows, screens, and states. Note copy/microcopy, tone, and empty/error state messages. Link to wireframes/prototypes.

### Data Model and Events
Outline entities and fields touched by this epic. Define analytics events and properties to instrument, and data retention rules.

### APIs and Integration Contracts
List APIs (internal/external), request/response schemas, auth methods, rate limits, timeouts, and error handling. Note versioning and backward compatibility expectations.

### Security, Privacy, and Compliance (Epic)
Identify sensitive data, required consents, access control rules, audit logging, and any regulatory constraints specific to this epic.

### Experimentation Plan
If applicable, define hypothesis, primary/secondary metrics, sample size/duration estimates, variants, and stop/ship criteria.

### Accessibility and Internationalization
State a11y targets (e.g., WCAG AA) and localization considerations (date/time, number formats, copy externalization).

### Edge Cases and Error Handling
Enumerate notable edge cases, failure modes, and user‑facing error behaviors. Define retry/backoff strategies and idempotency where needed.

### Rollout Plan (Epic)
Define feature flags, cohorts, ramp plan, and rollback triggers. Specify comms to affected users/stakeholders.

### Acceptance Criteria and Test Plan
List acceptance criteria per major story/flow. Outline test strategy: unit, integration, E2E, manual QA, and UAT sign‑off criteria.

### Risks and Mitigations (Epic)
List top risks for this epic with severity/likelihood, mitigations, and owners. Link to RAID entries as needed.

### Dependencies and Cross‑Epic Impacts
Note dependencies on other epics and how changes here might impact them. Include sequencing/risk of rework.

### Estimation and Capacity
Provide a rough effort estimate (t‑shirt sizing or story points) and capacity planning notes, even if solo. Call out any spikes.

### Timeline and Milestones (Epic)
Lay out start date, key milestones, and ETA. Include any gates (design complete, API stable) and exit criteria.

### Definition of Done (Epic)
State the criteria to consider the epic complete: code, tests, docs, runbooks, metrics dashboards live, and post‑launch review scheduled.

### Post‑Release Monitoring
Define the KPIs, dashboards, and alerts you will monitor; the observation window; and a plan to iterate based on findings.

### Epic Appendix
Include links to designs, API specs, diagrams, and any domain references specific to this epic.
