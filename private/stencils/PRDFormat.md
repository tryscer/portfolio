## Overview and Context
Briefly explain what you are building, for whom, and why now. Tie to business outcomes. Keep to 3–5 sentences. Link any prior docs or prototypes.

## Problem Statement
Describe the user and business pain in clear terms. Quantify current impact (lost revenue, churn, time cost). Identify root causes, not just symptoms.

## Goals and Non-Goals
- Goals: 3–5 measurable outcomes for this release (e.g., activation, conversion, retention). 
- Non-Goals: What will not be addressed now to avoid scope creep.

## Target Users and Personas
Define primary and secondary users. Include brief persona snapshots (context, motivations, constraints). If assumptions, mark them explicitly.

## Market and Competitive Context
Summarize relevant alternatives/competitors and differentiators. Note switching costs and table-stakes expectations.

## User Insights and Assumptions
List known insights from interviews/analytics/support. Document key assumptions to validate, and any regulatory/operational realities affecting users.

## Jobs To Be Done and Key Use Cases
Capture top Jobs To Be Done. Translate into 5–8 critical use cases with trigger, actor, success outcome, and failure modes.

## Scope
State what’s in scope and out of scope for this PRD. Describe boundaries (inputs, system, outputs). Note any phased items.

## Success Metrics
Define the One Metric That Matters (OMTM) plus supporting KPIs and guardrails. Include targets and time horizon.

## Solution Overview
High-level narrative of how the solution works end-to-end. How it fits the ecosystem. Mention alternatives considered and why not chosen.

## User Experience
- Flows: Enumerate key flows; link sketches/wireframes (Lovable prototypes acceptable). 
- States: Empty/loading/error/success states that require design. 
- Content: Key copy (microcopy, consent, error messages). 
- Accessibility: A11y goals (keyboard nav, contrast, labels, screen reader cues).

## Functional Requirements
Numbered, testable requirements. Use Must/Should/Could priority. Example: FR-1: <description>.

## Non-Functional Requirements
Performance, reliability, availability, security, privacy, localization, accessibility. Example: p95 latency < Xs; uptime target; WCAG level.

## Data Model and Integrations
- Data Model: Key entities/fields at a high level. 
- Events: Critical events for tracking and system reactions. 
- Integrations: External systems/APIs, auth methods, quotas, error handling. 
- Storage/Retention: Where data lives; retention/deletion policies.

## Security, Privacy, and Compliance
Threat considerations, data classification, encryption, access controls, consent, audit trails. Map applicable regs (e.g., GDPR/CCPA/PCI/HIPAA) and user-rights flows (export/delete).

## Analytics and Instrumentation
List events/properties and funnels. Define dashboards for OMTM and guardrails. Note any experimentation or feature flags.

## Delivery Plan (Solo Operator + Lovable)
Outline build strategy as a solo operator. What will be prototyped in Lovable vs. custom code. Weekly cadence, timeboxing, decision log, and criteria to graduate from prototype to production.

## MVP Plan and Phasing
Define MVP scope to learn fastest. Then P1/P2 enhancements. Add a milestone timeline (2–4 checkpoints), basic test plan (happy path + edge cases), and rollout plan (private beta → GA).

## Risks and Mitigations
List top product/tech/legal/delivery risks with mitigations and triggers to revisit. Include unknowns and a plan to de-risk (spikes, RATs, pilots).

## Operational Readiness
Plan monitoring, alerting, logging, and support. Define SLOs, error budgets, incident response (even if solo), rollback plan, and minimal runbooks.

## Go-To-Market
Positioning, target segments, pricing/packaging, channels, and launch checklist. Success criteria and feedback loop to capture learnings post-launch.

## Dependencies and Open Questions
List internal/external dependencies and owners/dates. Capture open questions with owners and due dates. Keep updated through delivery.

## Appendix
Glossary, references, prior research, architectural or flow diagrams. Place helpful but non-essential material here.
