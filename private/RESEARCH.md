# Research: Moving from Form-Filling to Free-Text UX on Listing Sites

Goal recap: illustrate a possible UX helping users move from form-filling to free text entry on listing sites.

## Top 10 research questions

1. User-task fit: For which listing scenarios and user segments does free-text outperform forms (conversion, time-to-complete, satisfaction)?
2. Natural input patterns: What do users actually type when describing a listing (common intents, entities, constraints, synonyms, tone)?
3. Schema mapping: How reliably can free-text be mapped to required backend schema fields across categories, and where are the biggest gaps?
4. Clarification flows: Which patterns best resolve ambiguity or missing data with minimal friction (suggested chips, inline prompts, follow-up questions)?
5. Trust and control: What preview/edit mechanisms build user confidence (structured preview, change tracking, inline field provenance)?
6. Accuracy thresholds: What extraction accuracy and confidence thresholds are acceptable before asking for confirmation or fallback to fields?
7. Latency tolerance: What response-time thresholds keep users engaged, and which loading/skeleton patterns mitigate perceived delay?
8. Accessibility and internationalization: How do screen readers, input methods, and multilingual inputs affect comprehension and extraction quality?
9. Privacy and compliance: What PII or sensitive data may be entered, and how should we handle masking, consent, storage, and retention?
10. Measurement and experiments: Which metrics and A/B test designs demonstrate superiority over forms (conversion, time, data completeness, error rate, rework)?
