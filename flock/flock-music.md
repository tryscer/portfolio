# Side 1: Alice

## Track 1: Alice Takes a Road Trip

*…from Greensboro, NC, to Richmond, VA.*

> *It's morning in America, folks, and DJ Jonah here, coming to you LIVE on the air from a SECRET LOCATION up in the BIRD'S NEST, overlooking a beautiful valley which shall NOT BE NAMED… and let me tell you, listener JANE and listener JOHN… let me tell you… it's overrun with birds today, big ones, small ones, green ones and white ones, flocking together, going their own way, this way and then the other… Did you know the ancient ROMANS, Caesar himself, would read the future by the flight of the birds? Anyway, here's The CORDETTES with LOLLIPOP…*

*Ba-boom-boom-boom…*

It is 1958 and a record is playing on the little record player I got for my sweet sixteenth. It's an early-summer morning and the windows in my childhood bedroom are open, inviting fresh cut grass smells and fat, lazy bumblebees. I'm dancing with myself, keeping one eye on my bedroom door, lest it should suddenly open.

*Gee, my lollipop is HHHWWWONK!*

I peer through the window overlooking the street and Cindy's brother's Chevy, red with white top and sides, is parked beside our house.

"Be quiet!" I say, laughing, waving my hands at them to pipe down. I lift the needle from the little record,

*(Lolli-SCRATCH!)*

and stuff some necessities into my handbag: a little powder kit, my babysitting fortune of $17.62, and, after some thought, a clean pair of cream-colored panties.

"We'll all gonna be late, Peaches!" yells Cindy from the car. I shoo at her and climb down the Elm tree planted beneath my bedroom window.

I run across my parents' front lawn, stealthy and undetected. I slip into the back seat. Inside it's full of people and already steaming hot: Cindy, in the middle, sits next to a girl I think I know, their cousin from New York; in front, it's Barry, sweating at the wheel, and a mystery boy, flexen-haired and wearing sunglasses, sitting next to him. Ricky Nelson is singing on the radio about having been a little fool.

"Peaches!"

"Don't call me that, *Bark*," I say to Barry and give Cindy a hug. Cindy says quietly, "I've got something to–"

"Who's she?" says the girl next to her.

"Oh," says Cindy, storing her secret. "I want you to meet my favorite cousin, Puppy".

"Elanora," Puppy says, dryly, looking at her fingernails. With her dark hair and eyes she's a sharp contrast to Cindy's blonde and blue. Cindy lays a hand on Puppy's knee and says, "We're taking Puppy back to the train station going home. She lives in *New-York-City*, you know". Puppy winces.

"We've met before," I tell Puppy.

"Have we?" says Puppy, disinterested. She pushes Cindy's hand away.

"Alright boys and girls, here we go," says Barry and turns the wheel. We jerk in our seats as the old jalopy springs into action. I give Cindy an important look and signal at the mystery boy. "Oh," says Cindy, her voice taking on that party hostess quality, "this of course is Barry's friend Tim". She whispers in my ear, "he has *all* the records". To Tim she says, "please meet Peaches".

"Don't call me that," I whisper to her.

"It's, eh, it's nice to meet you," I say to Tim.

"So what's your real name, then?" he says. From his seat, right in front of me, he can only look at me through the rear view mirror. In the little frame I see his shades sitting atop his beautiful nose. He has a deep voice, deeper than Barry's, and he's wearing a very tight tee-shirt.

"It's, ah," I say, gracefully, "it's Peggy Sue".

Cindy and Bark snort with laughter. "Tell him your *real* name, Peaches," says Cindy.

"It's Allison," I whisper.

"What? Alice?" says Tim, already looking away. It seems Cindy's betrayal has cost me what little attention he had for me.

"Yeah, I guess," I mumble. "Alice would do".

"My little wonderland girl," Cindy laughs, holding my hand. I instantly forgive her. "Here's to Alice!"

Barry and Tim join in a choir: "Alice!"

We all laugh. Somebody turns the volume up…

*(Splish splash! I was having a bath!)*

---

"Now, *Alice*, I'm responsible over you," says Barry. Scenic Greensboro rolls across the windows: the trimmed green lawns and rustic red stone of Collage Park. "I assume you told your parents you would be riding with me?"

"Of course," I lie. "Mamma sends her regards".

"Much obliged. Now, there might be some rough customers at the Fair today, so you girls stick close to me and Tim," says Barry. I think, "Boy, does he like to say 'Now' with such gravitas".

"Oh," says Barry. "And, now, no talking to strangers".

"Alice has never been to a live show before," says our hostess. "This is going to be her first one".

"Aha," I say, "my very first show".

"A newbie!" says Puppy. Clearly my new-ness has increased my interest in her eyes. "Well, you know, both Tim and myself have been to *dozens* of shows, and Cindy, you've been to a handful yourself, right?"

I wonder at the reason for the obvious slight and quickly find him in the front seat, peering at the map from atop his shades. His sweat glistens in the late morning sun.

Cindy presses against me. I look to my left: Puppy and Cindy are a foot apart. Both are locking sights on Tim. It suddenly feels very hot in the car. "Tim told *me*," says Cindy, "that it's not the number of shows, it's the quality of the show. Isn't that right, Tim?"

"That's right, kidd-o".

Puppy ventures, "Is the show we're going to… in your opinion, of course…"

"Well," says Tim, and looks back at Puppy, "well, other kidd-o…" – both girls wince at that – "*this* will be the show of your young life. Years from now, when you're… like… fifty or something… you'll tell your grandkids all about that show you saw today". He is glib, juvenile, and prophetically right. The sun going through the strands of his blonde hair seem to fill me with pleasant tingles.

"What's their name, pretty?" I say. I realize what it is I said when everybody, Barry included, turn to look at me. "What's their pretty name I mean. I mean I bet their name is real pretty". I sink into my seat and add: "Um".

Barry and Tim exchange disgusted, amused looks. To my horror, Cindy and Puppy do the same. It seems my catastrophe has reunited them… if only for a moment. The next one, Cindy is saying, "Puppy, have *you* been to any good shows? I mean really good ones. Because, you know…"

Tim cuts through Cindy's *Coup de Grace* by shoving a piece of paper in my face: "The Seven-Tops. They're from *Nashville*". The piece of paper lists the many ACTS and SHOWS and POINTS OF INTEREST in this year's RICHMOND, VA'S COUNTY FAIR - ACHIEVEMENT DAY! — among them, and circled in red, are the SEVEN-TOPS, to be playing at 2:30 p.m., right after THE BURNING BUSH RAILWAY COMPANY. I imagine a long train, all set ablaze, and I shudder.

"What's Achievement Day?" I ask.

"This is the day set apart for Black performers and fairgoers," says Barry from behind the wheel. "It is, also, the reason we're driving there today. Officially".

"Black performers?" I whisper. I feel so rebellious and free that I have half a mind to pull Tim's face to mine and see if he kisses me.

"That's right, Bark's got a real important job to do!" cries Cindy. "He is sent by Father on a top-secret mission!"

"Be quiet, sister", says Barry, not looking too hurt.

"What's your secret mission, Barry?" asks Puppy.

"He needs to personally smoke every cigarette in the fair!"

"You talk to me like that," says Barry, "when you have a real job. And I'm inspecting the cigarette *girls*. For Father's company. It's a perfectly respectable–"

"Really, Bear?" says Tim. "You're to personally inspect each cigarette girl?"

"Not you, too!"

The car is loud with howling and laughter.

---

We're passing the sign saying we are leaving beautiful Greensboro, NC, population of 79,000, and another, advocating the smoking of Buzz Cigarettes. Elvis comes on the radio, his presence announced by an overwhelming procession of staccato guitar riffs.

*(y-y-ouaaain't nothing but a hound…dog)*

"Because," says Cindy, picking up a thread of conversation long forgotten by everyone else, "I've seen *Elvis*".

Puppy and Tim turn to her faster than Barry could do doughnuts in the elementary school parking drive.

[...]

---

"So, um, Tim," I say. "Cindy says you have all the records".

[...]

---

Way ahead, in front, Barry and Tim are arguing over the road map. In the relative privacy the argument affords, Cindy turns to me.

"Hey listen", she says. "Listen, I need to –"

"Here's a little tip for the music show neophyte," says Puppy. Cindy abandons her secret again. "What you do is you bring an extra pair of panties along with you. This way you can throw'em on stage and still be comfortable on your way home".

"Why would you throw your panties at anyone?" I ask, disgusted.

"It's just what you do," insists Puppy.

"Every time?" I ask.

"Not every time, no," says Puppy, exasperated. "You save it for special occasions".

"Like what?"

"Like," says Puppy, and her face takes on a dreamy quality, "if they sing a song that makes you feel…" she wanders off.

"Feel what?"

"It's when you feel, like, tingles in your panties".

I'm horrified: like ants in my pants?

"I threw'em once," says Cindy. "At Elvis".

Puppy is flabbergasted.

"Did you hit 'im?" I ask. We giggle.

"I hit some other dude," says Cindy. "One of the players. Elvis asked me if I wasn't too cold".

[...]

---

[...]

The radio is blaring. "What did you want to tell me?" I say in Cindy's ear.

*(well-she-goan-sentout-aworldwide HOO-do broOM BROOM BROOM)*

*"What?" says Cindy.*

*(that'll-be-the-VE..ree thing that BROOM BROOM BROOM BROOM BROOM BROOM–)*

"What's happening with the car?" asks Tim. Cindy leans closer to me, grabbing my hand.

(BROOM BROOM BROOM! BROOM BROOM BROOM!)

"Dunno," says Barry. "We'll all be better off finding a place to–"

Cindy whispers in my ear, "I'm running away from home".

---

For the last two miles Barry and Tim had to push the car, with elder girl Puppy sitting at the wheel, and all of them engaged in a half-angry shouting match.

"You'll push us into the ditch!" Puppy yells. "Tim, put your back into it! Bark is pushing twice as hard as you!"

"Will you shut your little mouth and steer the car?"

And so on.

Cindy and I are sitting in the back seat, holding hands.

"Why would you leave me?" I whisper.

"I'm not… I'm not leaving you".

"You are".

"Yeah, but it's not… it's not you I'm leaving… I have to–"

"Tim, you lazy boy! Start shoving!"

"Shut up, little girl!"

"I have to… you know, I need to–"

"Thank God almighty, there's a service station up ahead!"

And so on.

When we reach the Shell Durham Service Station (LARRY'S JUKE JOINT ADJACENT!). It's sunny, so hot even the tarmac is sweating. The service station provides little in the way of shade. There's the office, where presumably the service guy is hiding, though it's probably even hotter there with the black tin roof, and there is one pump island with two pumps on it, but it doesn't seem like anyone has been using them lately. Someone thought it was a good idea to have a planter with some greens near the office entrance, but currently they look more like blacks, and yellows, if you count the dust lying heavily on them and on all other surfaces. We can see the workshop behind the office, where a carcass of a car lays hopeless, and a little bit ahead a shack of sorts. Judging by the empty beer bottles near the door, people come there for business.

Both Barry and Tim are drenched with sweat. Barry leans on Tim, breathing hard; to our communal delight, Tim has taken off his shirt and is using it to dry his face. We girls leave the car – to get fresh air, of course.

"Fill 'er up?" says the stocky man in overalls who appeared as if out of nowhere.

Barry says, "I'm afraid there's not much to fill up, unless we can fix her".

Puppy says to Cindy, "he means fix *you*".

"Shut up".

"I can fix her," says Tim.

"Hell you can," says Barry.

"Hell he sure can," whispers Cindy to Puppy.

"Shut up the both of you," I whisper to the girls.

Tim says, "they have a little garage over there, with tools and everything–"

"The mechanic's sort of in," says the man in overalls.

"That's great!" says Barry. "Where can we find him? Wait, what do you mean sorta?"

"Well," says the man in overalls, "he's in the Juke Joint".

"I'll help you fix the car," Puppy says to Tim. To her chagrin, he is putting on his shirt.

"I'll help you," says Cindy. "I actually know what I'm doing".

"Please take me with you," I say to Barry.

Larry's Juke Joint is one small room, dark even in the morning, with a swinging door, four tables and an old jukebox. The jukebox is playing a record I know — "Wake Up, Little Susie", by the Everly brothers. Next to the jukebox, two young men sit next to two glasses and a half-full bottle.

"Please, no more," says one of them. He looks at his glass with disgust.

"Come on," says the other. "I thought you said you could drink". He's got a foreign accent and he's wearing a mechanic's overalls. An embroidered patch on his chest says his name is Eddie.

We come closer.

"Excuse me," says Barry, official-like. The man whose name is probably Eddie looks up. He's got black eyes and black hair, combed up like a wall above his head. He's very handsome.

"If you're looking for Larry, you gotta hollar through the door," he says. "He's in the kitchen making his terrible barbecue".

"Actually," says Barry, "we need a mechanic".

"Tough luck. He's not in today".

"You're wearing a mechanic's uniform," says an indigent Barry.

"Just keeping his shirt warm. Come on," he says to the sallow-looking fellow next to him, "one last round. I'll give you triple or nothing".

"No more, Eddie," says the sallow man. "Please, no more". He looks at his glass again – it's about one eighth full – and burps thoughtfully.

"Excuse me very much," says Barry. "We have a vehicle in urgent need of repair".

"Oh," says Eddie. "I didn't know it was a *vehicle*. I thought you just had car trouble. In that case, I am *forlorn* to inform you that this very Thursday happens to be the National Day of Appreciation For the Italian-American Partnership, and *in light* of that, and the fact that Max just told me I'm a slob, and at that a lazy one, our *vehicle repair* services are shut down for the day". The other man laughs – a drunkard's laugh, interrupted by belches. He then proceeds to crash his head into the table. Moments later he's snoring. Whiskey pours from his glass onto the table and drips on the floor.

I look at Barry thinking. He's obviously never been in this kind of situation before. "Eddie," he says. "Can I call you Eddie?"

"Don't know an Eddie," says Eddie.

"This guy just called you Eddie!"

"That drunk?"

"The hell with you, man. We'll fix our *car* ourselves".

I take a deep breath. I say, "Please, mister. We've got an important errand to run".

Eddie's dark eyes turn to me. His attention is intense, not entirely unpleasant.

"What's your important errand, young lady?"

"Well," I say, shifting my weight from leg to leg, "we've got to go see my very first live show".

Barry looks at me like he would look at an infantile, but Eddie's mollified.

"Oh," he says. "I didn't know you guys were music fans".

"So will you fix our car?"

"Well…" says Eddie. "I'll fix your car. *If*, and only if, you play our little game here. As you can see, my play partner" – he slaps the back of the poor fellow lying on the table – "is temporarily indisposed".

"We have no interest in playing your games," says Barry.

"I'll play your game," I say. Barry nudges me, but not hard.

"Good," says Eddie. "Good". He gets up nimbly and goes towards that jukebox.

*(...our friends when they-say… oooooooh la la!)*

"Now this here jukebox," says Eddie, "has a unique, one can say a *one-of-a-kind* behavior. It seems that when you kick it…" he kicks the jukebox like it was a bad dog. The life drains out of the jukebox. Its lights dim, the music slows and stops…

*(wake up, little suuuuuuuu–)*

…then wakes up again, bright-lights, but no music.

"This lead me to develop a game. This is my game: I'll play you the first two bars of a song of my choosing. Then I'll kick the jukebox. If you guess the song correctly, I'll attend to your *vehicle*".

"What if we don't?" I ask.

"Then you, my dear, take a drink, and I take one myself, and we live to play another round".

"Absolutely not," says Barry.

"Come on!" I say to him. "I can win this!"

"Young lady," says Barry. "I promised your mother I'll look after you. No way am I letting a *minor* drink".

"You're only two years older than me, you know… *old man*".

"Excuse me," says Eddie. "Are you, sir, a minor?"

Barry straightens his back. "If you must know, I'm eighteen years old and an adult in the eyes of the North Carolina law".

"So you do the drinking".

Barry and I look at each other.

"Well," says Eddie. "Pull out a chair".

We do.

"Of course," says Eddie, "I would require some coinage, as my play partner ran through his when he failed to recognize Les Paul and Mary Ford's 'How High The Moon'".

"Give him some coins", I whisper to Barry. "I could have guessed that in a heartbeat!"

"It's a bad idea," says Barry.

"Come on!"

Barry sighs and drops some dimes on the table. Eddie scoops them up with a gambler's trained hand.

"Round one!" he exclaims. He turns and fiddles. Then three fast drumbeats emanate from the jukebox. Then four tinny, bending plucks on an electric guitar… Eddie turns to us, smiles and kicks the jukebox.

Both guys look at me. Even the drunkard on the table has got one eye half open.

"That's easy," I say with glee. "Roll Over Beethoven. Now fix my friend's car please".

"Not so fast, Susie Q", says Eddie. My heart sinks. "You are correct in identifying the genius guitarslinger involved, but got the song all wrong. This, of course, is Rolly Polly by Chuck Barry".

"I told you," whispers Barry. The drunkard goes back to sleep. Eddie pushes his glass towards Barry and gleefully tilts the bottle over it. Barry looks at his glass, then at the passed-out man next to him.

This goes on for a while.

"And I'll tell you one other thing!" says Barry. He's quite drunk. [...]

"I'll get the next one, Bark, I'm sorry", I say.

---

*WEEEEEEEEEEE! Unnnnnnngg…*

The chevy's headliner starts flashing pink, I look back through the window. Oh shoot, a police car, with its Gumball on: a little red sun floating over the car's white roof of a horizon, signalling trouble. I look out through the rear window at the car, a big black and white sedan, curvy and beefy, shiny and well equipped – big round headlights, searchlights hanging from outside the windows, a huge chrome grill, and a big man in sunglasses behind the wheel.

Barry is sinking a bit, looking at Tim for reassurance. Tim nods, "Well, I guess we should pull over".

As we stop on the gravelly side, the police car pulls behind us. The driver opens the door, struggles a bit to get out, then puts his respectable face on again and start walking toward Barry's window. As he passes us I see his well ironed, two-toned uniform, shaping his round belly into a tight bunch, his white mustache, groomed and waxed, his heavy belt dripping with the tools of policing, including a big gun right out of westerns, and a gleaming gold star on his chest, like a guiding light he follows.

As we are nearing Richmond, the highway becomes somewhat more packed and slow. The exit we take is taken by a lot of other cars, some converted buses and old, rugged sedans with hand written signs on them, saying things like "St. John's A.M.E. Choir Bus - On the Road to Freedom!" or "Music Heals the Soul!". We are definitely not in Kansas anymore, and I feel my heart sinking, like a lion. There is no mistaking where the fair's entrance is, with all the cars heading that way, and it definitely is a relief to see some uniformed men directing the traffic. The closest man's expression changes from firm to a grin as we come close, he gives Barry a nod, commenting something like "you young kids be sure to watch out" and points us to the parking lot entrance.

We drive in and its full of cars, and people walking between them. Cindy comments "I would expected there will be a designated parking for people like us, near the entrance", but Barry hushes her and says "Today everyone gets to park and celebrate the same, we'll just go down the field and find a spot". As we drive slowly, the masses of people walking part in front of our car, keeping their distance.

We find a parking space, right after a truck full of hay and the smell of fresh manure. Barry makes sure everyone tightly shut their windows, and we start moving, following the sounds of music, farm animals and crowds cheering. It takes us at least five minutes to walk back to the gate.

## Track 2

"…and no talking to strangers," Barry says and laughs.

Over the past hour I have come to a decision. During the show, I will wait for that tingle in my underwear that Cindy warned me about. At that moment I will reach into my handbag and throw my extra pair of panties unto the stage. It will be my rite of passage into adulthood.

## Track 3

Eddie looks miffed. "Why do you want to go to your first show so badly anyway".

"You wouldn't understand," I shoot back. "You're a *boy*".

## Track 4

"He sure looks like him," she shouts.

But my ear, that has heard this voice so often, knows different. It was the same set of fingers on that keyboard, the same playful southern drawl.

"It is him," I say.

"What do you mean?"

"I mean it's friggin Jerry Lee Lewis up there on stage!" I shout, and then clasp my fingers around my mouth: I've never cussed in public before. My heart races… a deep fantasy, ancient and hidden, has just been fulfilled. I compare the Jerry Lee in those deep memories, compiled from his likeness on album covers, to the camouflaged man on stage.

*"Kiss me, baby—ooooh! Feels good!"*

I do feel good.

What is *up* with this band?

---

I stuff my panties back in my bag, feeling all grown up already before I turn to Tim and kiss the hell out of him.

---

"There," shouts Cindy, "now we've all kissed Tim! So we won't have to ever worry about that!"

"I'm not sure I like what I hear," says Tim.

"Shut up," says Barry, "you've just been kissed by three gorgeous ladies". He clasps him around the neck, a manly pose. I'm struck by how different Barry looks now. It's not just the lack of coat and tie that makes him look so… so beautifully loose…

I'm looking at Cindy and Puppy hugging. Puppy kisses Cindy's cheek. Tim and Barry are dancing very close now, locking sights.

I choke. "I love you guys," I say.

Cindy comes over and kisses me. The need to dance subsides. We hug, but we also still kind of swoosh and sway.

"I've been to my first show," I say to her. She looks at me and pats my cheek.

"You have, Alice of Wonderland," she says. "You have".

"This was the most beautiful moment of my life," I say. "And now I fear it's gone". I start crying and she hugs me and doesn't say anything. I think she's thinking the same thing.

After a while the dancing ebbs out, like the energy running out of a lightbulb… first in a steady decline and then in sputters of sudden idleness. The thirty or so people in the room are looking at each other as if they all woke up together from a weird dream. Shy looks at first, but then looks that say *yes, I've seen what you've seen myself and you're not crazy and it did, in fact, happen, and by the way, brother or sister, how cool was that?* followed by a quiet, almost mute display of hand-shaking and cheek-kissing and shoulder-clasping… someone at the back of the room shouts, "I love everybody here" and it doesn't sound strange. In fact, it sounds oddly and quietly true.

The redheaded girl runs over to me, her freckled face beaming.

"I'm Kimberly," she says and hugs me. Her friends come over. Their names are Martha and Duke.

We all hug.

The thirty of us leave as a group.

Cindy, Kimberly and me walk outside together. In the parking lot, the Conductors are waiting for us: Eddie and Rosetta and five or six others, all holding bunches of braids and looking holy and filled with purpose. Eddie beelines towards me. I run to him and hug him and kiss his stubbly cheek.

"I've been to my first ever show, Eddie!"

He smiles broadly and hands me a braid. It's a simple, uncolored wool braid but it has two coins slotted on it. They jingle against one another in my hand.

"What's this for, Eds?"

"For being, as I already predicted, young lady, chosen".

Then his smile fades. He says, "we leave tonight for Fuckington".

"You sound like you're saying goodbye," I say. He says nothing, just turns away. He turns to Kimberly's friend Martha and gives her a big wide smile and hands her a braid and says, "we leave tonight for Fuckington".

All around me, Conductors are handing us all braids and saying that they're leaving tonight for Fuckington.

I shout at Eddie, now far away, "hey!"

"What, Alice of Wonderland?"

"How do you get chosen, Eddie?"

He smiles and walks away. All the Conductors are leaving, having depleted their stock of braids.

"You choose," he shouts back through the empty street. Rosetta throws her arm around his shoulder as they walk. "That's how you get chosen. You choose".

Then, for the first time since the show started, it's *actually* quiet.

Kimberly is putting on the braid Eddie handed to her. I see she already has one. The coins from her two braids all jingle together.

"Will I see you in Fuckington?" she asks. I look at Barry with a sinking heart. Now that he's outside, breathing normal people air again, what would he do?

"Will you paint on your car tonight, Alice?"

We stand there, all looking at each other.

Then this one guy walks over to his car. I think he's leaving but he bends over, reaches behind the wheel, pops his trunk open. He takes a big can of red paint and a brush and he's singing, singing to himself or to us,

*"I'm-a gonna paint me
grRRREAT balls of fi-re
I'm-a …bout to paint me…"*

"Another bird joins the flock," says Kimberly.

When he's finished, some other guy comes and takes the brush, turning towards his car. Somebody found a few more paintbrushes in his trunk and he puts them in the middle of the little clearing. Some more paint cans are found – candy-apple red, mint-green, midnight blue – and then some aerosol spray cans, too. One girl paints a striking image of a Tropical Turquoise heart melting over her front door. Someone transforms his '52 Bel Air into a rainbow. A group of young workmen are busy filling every surface – doors, windows, roof – on their little van with all the lyrics they could remember. They use paint, they use Magic Markers. They are humming the songs as they do that. I suddenly realize how filled with song that little carlit parking lot has become. At that point I am hit by an image I will never forget: a flock of birds convening mid-flight, matching their speed, sharing their direction, and always changing, rearranging: a leader becoming a follower. A follower becoming a leader.

I whisper to Cindy, "talk to him. Tell him. Tell him you'll be leaving either way".

But Cindy knows her brother better. "Just look," she says.

I am looking at Barry; he is looking at the people in the clearing and nodding, as if to an unheard beat.

"Yes, yes," he says. "Any why the hell not?"

He walks towards the middle of the parking lot, where paint and brushes are waiting.

# Side 2: Tim

It was a different time, you know? Very different.

# Side 3: Prof. Elenore Rose

# Side 4: Barry

In her Book of Questions, Alice asks us, "why do people enjoy fighting?". Reading this question…
