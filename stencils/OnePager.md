## Summary
2–3 sentences covering what you’re building, for whom, and why now. Include the key outcome you expect and the fastest path to validate.

## Problem
State the user pain and business pain succinctly. Quantify impact if possible (lost revenue, churn, wasted time). Root cause, not symptoms.

## Solution
High-level narrative of how it works (no deep tech). Show how Lovable or lightweight tooling accelerates validation. Mention the smallest end-to-end slice.

## Value Proposition
- User value: What improves for the user and by how much.  
- Business value: Expected lift in activation/conversion/retention/revenue.

## Target Users
Primary and secondary users; the one persona you will design for first.

## Differentiation
How this differs from alternatives. Table-stakes you must meet; features you will ignore for now.

## Success Metrics
Define OMTM and 2–3 supporting KPIs with directional targets and guardrails.

## Scope (MVP vs. Later)
- MVP: The minimum to validate the core bet.  
- Later: Nice-to-haves and scale enablers.

## Timeline and Milestones
Brief timeline with 2–4 checkpoints (prototype, pilot, GA). Note any critical-path dependencies.

## Risks and Assumptions
Top 3–5 risks with brief mitigations. List the assumptions you will validate first.

## Go-To-Market Snapshot
Audience, channels, simple launch plan, and the feedback loop you’ll use to iterate.

## Links
Designs, prototypes, tracking dashboards, prior research, and related docs.
